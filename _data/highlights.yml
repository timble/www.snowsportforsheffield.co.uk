    header: Public facebook group created
    body: Snowsports for Sheffield was born out of a closed Facebook group made up of past workers and visitors to the Sheffield Ski Village. As a result of Team GB's performance in Sochi and the fact many of these athletes had trained and competed at the Ski Village we decided we should do something about it!

    header: Lease holder's ideas put on ice!
    body: The lease holder applied to the Sheffield City Council to allow planning permission to pull all the slope material and rubbish into a big landfill at the bottom of the slope. By doing so the topography of the site would have fundamentally changed. Perfect for building homes on.

    header: We beat the Planning Application!
    body: The next meeting followed a on-site inspection of the Ski Village and careful examination of the proposed plans. The result was the council recommended that the lease holder's plan be approved. It was only after Snowsports' passionate defence of the slope the council voted unanimously to reject these plans.
