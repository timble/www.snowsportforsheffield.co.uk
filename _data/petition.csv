I learnt to snowboard there, developed my love of the sport, met so many fantastic people, some of who are lifelong friends and one who is now my husband, and had so many great times. I watched and aspired to those Olympic snowboarders and skiers who have just done us proud in Sochi. It wasn't just a sports centre, it was a way of life for many including myself. And I hoped that one day I would take my kids there too. Well fingers crossed by the time our baby's due the Snowsport Centre will be up and running, or at lesat in the process of being developed. Us and generations to come need facilities like this!!! "

It made winter sports accessible to everyone irrespective of age and finances, and for me it made Sheffield what it is. That half of the UKs free-ski team and snowboarding's Dom Harrington came from the slope is a testament to the enormous amount of talent the place has nurtured and produced over the years. An incredible place."

2179,"Stephen Cavell","2014-02-28 22:52:08","Went up last week, gates wide open, site has become a area for fly tippers, such a shame. After watching the Sochi 2014 winter olympics and slopestyle, Katie Summerhayes & Jenny Jones my daughter would like to take up snowboarding and would have been nice to have some where more local to go than xscape in Castleford / Wakefiled. The decline of the Ski Village started after the Sheffield City Planners turned down proposals to turn the slopes in to a Indoor venue and Aline style village about 4/5 years ago, if Sheffield Planners had approved the scheme Sheffield Ski Village would have been the best winter sports venue in the country !"

There was also going to be a down hill mountain bike section running alongside the slopes with a ski lift to help assist back to top. This in my opinion publicised will see hundreds of mountain bikes flock alongside the ski enthusiast to create a successful viable buisness. If heads where put together they could even be a long zip wire that could include some outdoor pursuit centre aswell. If designed correctly rather than just purely a ski village to appeal to more this could realy take off."

Skiing has provided me with a lifetime of exhilarating thrills, adrenaline filled runs and given me a love of  the mountains. I am now ready to pass this onto my 5 year old son, I want it to be something he can participate in weekly and grow and develop in the hope he has the same  love for the sport as I do.

I don't know who owns the land where the ski village is, however if it's the councils land they won't let it go to the community for nothing.   If a develop wants it they will sell it to line their greedy pockets no matter what is on there. "
